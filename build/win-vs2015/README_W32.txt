This folder contains a Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express (that's why it is
called -vce2010) solution to build Gem for Puredata.

If you want to built it from scratch yourself, you're very welcome.

Feel free to improve it yourself with your headache (because YES you will have
some...).

cheers
Antoine
